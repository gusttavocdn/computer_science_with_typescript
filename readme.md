# Computer Science with TS

## Brief

This project is basically a fork
of [The Arena Project Repository](https://github.com/the-arena-project/typescript-arenas) The goal
here was provide all the challenges in the original repository simplified for students who do not can pay for **The
Arena Course** now.

If you want to have the full experience you can access the site of the
project [The Arena Project](https://www.thearenaproject.co/) and subscribe in the course.

I intend to constantly update this repository as the original repository is updated as well.

## How to make the Challenges

All the challenges are placed in the **src** folder listed by themes numerically in the recommended order.

In the folder of each theme you will find a **suggested_order.json** file. This file contains the order of the
challenges in the theme. You can following this order. All the challenges has his own **challenge-en.md** to describe
what you are supposed to do. Follow the instructions rigorously and also take a look in the config.json.

As a general rule, you should adopt that it is **EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED** to use functions that are not listed as allowed
directly in the instructions for each challenge.
