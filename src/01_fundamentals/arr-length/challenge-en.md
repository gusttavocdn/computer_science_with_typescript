# Instructions

Write a function arrLength that returns the length of an array of numbers.

For the time being, we will consider that an array T ends when its element T[n] is equal to the value undefined for any
n >= 0.

Your function should conform to the following prototype:

```typescript
type ArrLengthFn = (arr: number[]) => number;
```

### Allowed Functions / Properties

- N/A

### Hint

- **Array.length** being a property, it is indeed forbidden, we won't repeat it again.
