# Instructions

Write a recursive function called recursiveFactorial that returns the factorial of nb such that nb >= 0.

This time, your function must be recursive. It's time to put into practice what you learned in today's video!

It must conform to the following prototype:

```typescript
type FactorialFn = (nb: number) => number
```
