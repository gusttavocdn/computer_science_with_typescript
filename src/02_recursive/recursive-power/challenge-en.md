Warning: for this exercise, it is forbidden to use the ** operator in TypeScript.

Write a function recursivePower that calculates nb raised to the power of power.

You must consider the following constraints:

- nb >= 0
- power >= 0

Your function must be recursive and conform to the following prototype:

```typescript
type PowerFn = (nb: number, power: number) => number
```
